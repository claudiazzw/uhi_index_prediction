# üåç Predicting Urban Heat Islands with AI

## Overview
Applying machine learning to predict urban heat island (UHI) hotspots in NYC and uncover key contributing factors driving temperature differences. Part of the 2025 EY Open Science AI & Data Challenge, this project aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, aiming to mitigate heat risks and create a more sustainable urban environment. üöÄ‚ôªÔ∏è
