## Methodologies

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ EDA: Correlation Analysis, Heatmap



### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering:

To enhance model performance, several feature engineering techniques were employed.

* **Normalization**: Data preprocessing included applying **StandardScaler** to normalize temperature and index values, ensuring that different features are on comparable scales.

* **Derived Features**: We combined **Sentinel-2 bands (B01, B06, B08)** and **Land Surface Temperature data (Landsat LST)** to compute **Normalized Vegetation Built-up Index (NVBI)**. This index was used to assess the balance between vegetation and built-up areas, which is a critical determinant of UHI intensity.

* **Vegetation and Heat Indicators**: Features such as **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** and **Land Surface Temperature anomalies (lst_anomaly)** were derived to capture heat absorption and vegetation cover influence on temperature variation.



### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Model:

We experimented with multiple machine learning models to predict UHI index values, with a focus on tree-based ensembles:

#### Random Forest:
* Handles high-dimensional data well and is robust to noise

* Effective at capturing complex, non-linear relationships between temperature and UHI-related features

* Provides feature importance rankings, aiding in understanding key contributors to UHI formation

#### XGBoost:
* More efficient and computationally optimized than traditional Random Forest

* Handles missing data effectively, which is crucial for satellite-derived datasets
   
* Performs well with structured data and has strong regularization capabilities, preventing overfitting in urban climate modeling


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning:

To optimize the performance of the Random Forest model, multiple hyperparameter configurations were tested. The main parameter adjusted was n_estimators, which determines the number of trees in the forest. The results of these experiments are summarized below:

| Model Used |  Parameters  | Feature Selection | Results |
|:-----------|:-----------:|---------------------:|------:|
| Random Forest  | n_estimators=100, random_state=42 | B01, B06, B08, NDVI, Landsat_LST, lst_anomaly | 0.7429 |
| Random Forest  | n_estimators=500, random_state=42 | B01, B06, B08, NDVI, Landsat_LST, lst_anomaly | 0.7476 |
| Random Forest  | n_estimators=1000, random_state=42 | B01, B06, B08, NDVI, Landsat_LST, lst_anomaly | 0.7489 |
